All mini projects from an OpenCV course.

## Project 1: Live Pencil Sketch App

### Output Preview

> *Notice that the edges of the clouds were also captured!*

### Steps
1. Convert input image to grayscale
2. Remove noise using **Gaussian Blur**
3. Use **Canny** algorithm to detect and extract edges
4. Apply threshold binary inverse to get white background with black edges (pencil sketch effect)

## Project 2: Shape Identifier

### Output Preview

### Steps
1. Convert input image to grayscale and apply thresholding
2. Extract contours from the shapes
3. Use `approxPolyDP` to get number of sides of the shape
4. Deduce the shape using number of sides. Any shape more than 15 sides is assumed to be a circle
5. Further use conditionals to handle special cases like square and rectangle
6. Fill the shape with color and shape name if identified

## Project 3: Circle/Ellipse Counter
*No preview available because the program somehow does not work on my machine.*

## Project 4: Object Detector Using Template Image

### Input Preview

### Output Preview

### Steps
1. Convert both input and template images to grayscale
2. Use `cv2.matchTemplate()` to return an array that represents the match found
3. Use `cv2.minMaxLoc()` to return the bounding box/coordinates that Mei was found in
4. Then use the coordinates to draw the green rectangle encasing the matching object

## Project 5: Live Object Detector Using SIFT and ORB
*No preview available because program is buggy. Need to check documentation.*

## Project 6: Live Pedestrian and Car Detector

### Pedestrian Detection Preview

### Car Detection Preview
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/wmI3876.jpg)

### Steps
1. Use .xml files for pedestrians and cars found on GitHub (trained by others)
2. Read in sample video and make it loop
3. For every frame of the video, use `detectMultiScale` to determine match
4. If match is present, draw a rectangle surrounding object
